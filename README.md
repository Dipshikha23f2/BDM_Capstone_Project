This project is a Business Data Management Capstone submitted as part of the IIT Madras BS Degree in Data Science program. It focuses on leveraging data analytics to improve sales, marketing, and inventory strategies for a local jewellery retailer in Bihar.

**📌 Project Overview**

Ajay Prasad Jewellers, a small B2C jewellery business located in Jehanabad, Bihar, faced challenges such as:

Inconsistent revenue

Poor inventory control

October: ₹2,217,076 (20% profit)

November: ₹701,897 (17% profit)

December: ₹1,324,985 (15% profit)

Key Issues Identified:
