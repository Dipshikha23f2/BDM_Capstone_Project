##**Optimizing Sales & Marketing Strategies for Sustainable Growth at Ajay Prasad Jewellers**


This project is a Business Data Management Capstone submitted as part of the IIT Madras BS Degree in Data Science program. It focuses on leveraging data analytics to improve sales, marketing, and inventory strategies for a local jewellery retailer in Bihar.

**📌 Project Overview**

Ajay Prasad Jewellers, a small B2C jewellery business located in Jehanabad, Bihar, faced challenges such as:

Inconsistent revenue

Poor inventory control

Pricing volatility due to gold market fluctuations

Seasonal demand impacts

Competitive pressure from local and branded retailers

This capstone project aims to develop data-driven strategies to optimize business performance using Excel, Google Sheets, and Python-based analytics.

**📊 Key Insights**

Monthly Revenue (Oct–Dec 2024):

October: ₹2,217,076 (20% profit)

November: ₹701,897 (17% profit)

December: ₹1,324,985 (15% profit)

Key Issues Identified:

Sales dipped drastically in November due to post-festival slump and understocking

Over ₹1.4 lakh in potential sales was lost due to limited inventory of high-demand items

Gold price fluctuations created procurement and pricing challenges


**📈 Methodology**
**🔹 Data Acquisition**

Manual data (receipts, invoices) digitized into 3 sheets:

Sales_Data

Purchase_Data

Inventory_Data

**🔹 Data Cleaning**

Normalized item names, standardized formats, corrected inconsistencies

Used Excel formulas (TEXT(), VALUE(), VLOOKUP(), etc.)

**🔹 Analysis Tools & Techniques**

Descriptive Statistics: Mean, median, std dev

Visualizations: Bar charts, line graphs, box plots (Google Sheets, Excel)

KPIs Tracked: Revenue, profit margin %, inventory turnover ratio

Dynamic Pricing & Forecasting: Regression-based forecasting planned

Inventory Optimization: ABC analysis and restocking threshold alerts
